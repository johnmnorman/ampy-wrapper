# ampy-wrapper

This is a little Python script that uses the subprocess module to make it easy to manage a Raspberry Pi Pico from the command line. It has a very simple interactivity with no tab completion or command history, and has not yet been subject to much use or testing. Requires that the tools ampy and tio be installed and in your $PATH. It wraps all of the commands available to ampy and provides the ability to drop into your Pi's REPL with tio. 

This script is pretty barebones, but it has all the basics to get started manipulating your Pico.
